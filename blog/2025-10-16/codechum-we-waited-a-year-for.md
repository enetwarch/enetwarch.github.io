# CodeChum We Waited a Year for?

CodeChum just got added to our curriculum and quite frankly it is an absolute mess. The one good thing I can say about it is the fact that it has a toggleable night or dark mode but at this point anything programming related should have that as a mandatory quality of life. The issues in codechum stem from many possible avenues however one of the biggest ones has got to be the fact that the checking isn’t working as intended. A lot of the problems are negligible HOWEVER, getting all the points requires a check mark on every condition yet sometimes codechum decides that your program is infinitely looping EVEN IF YOUR NOT USING RECURSIVE STATEMENTS OR HAVE A LOOP. Usually this is solved by just reloading the check however sometimes it doesn’t work and you essentially just lose points. While on the topic of checking, in java specifically you can’t check portions of code properly, why? It's because the way they check requires the entire bit of code to be written already as it won’t ever trigger the conditions correctly if you're just coding bit by bit or class by class. Which means you would need an IDE open to properly debug and check your code which makes codechum even more of a hassle to use.

Another thing is that if you're coding a somewhat large class you either have to save it or just make sure you are completely done with the question because if you happen to be unlucky codechum can just refresh and wipe your previous progress if you keep switching class tabs or even switching questions. Seeing as most codechum activities can be time limited this makes the possibility of failing due to RNG a possibility in a skill based subject. The issues don’t just lie in the service being lackluster, they also have a MASSIVE server issue. Sometimes loading up codechum can take up to 20 minutes, albeit this is only the case in conjunction with bad internet, it can still be very slow at home with somewhat high speeds (80mbps). It’s so problematic that the timeslots of class have you just waiting around 20 minutes to have a time crunch in the actual activity since you wasted those precious minutes trying to open up the site. At this point just give us the activities in canvas because quite frankly this service is not up to standard.
